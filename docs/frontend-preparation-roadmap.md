# Frontend Preparation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the development roadmap for backend changes required before frontend development can begin. These changes resolve 7 conflicts identified between the original architecture and the new frontend requirements.

**Project Status:** 38 tasks created in Archon Project ID: `250361b4-a882-4928-ba7a-e629775cc30e`

**Timeline Estimate:** 3-4 weeks (120-160 hours)

**Priority:** High - Frontend development is blocked until these tasks are complete

---

## Executive Summary

### What Changed?

The frontend requirements introduced significant new features and capabilities that require backend support:

1. **User Authentication & Roles** - 3 roles (Administrator, Editor, Writer) with permission matrix
2. **Writing Styles Feature** - AI-powered style analysis from writing samples
3. **Past Outputs Dashboard** - Comprehensive output tracking with grant success metrics
4. **Conversation Context** - Persistent context across sessions with version tracking
5. **Document Sensitivity** - Public document confirmation requirement (MVP)
6. **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive action tracking for all important operations
7. **Deployment Clarity** - Explicit single-tenant containerization model

### Impact on Architecture

- **5 new database tables:** users, user_sessions, writing_styles, outputs, expanded audit_log
- **2 modified tables:** conversations (add context, artifacts), documents (add sensitivity_confirmed)
- **15+ new API endpoints:** auth, users, writing-styles, outputs, audit-log
- **New services:** authentication, session management, style analysis, outputs management
- **Middleware:** role-based access control, comprehensive audit logging

## Timeline & Resource Allocation

### Week-by-Week Breakdown

**Week 1: Foundation (Phase 1)**
- Days 1-2: Alembic setup and initial migrations
- Days 3-4: Create all new tables and modify existing
- Day 5: Testing, validation, Pydantic models

**Week 2: Authentication (Phase 2)**
- Days 1-2: Auth service and session management
- Day 3: Role-based middleware
- Days 4-5: API endpoints and comprehensive testing

**Week 3: Core Features (Phases 3-4)**
- Days 1-2: Writing styles AI analysis and endpoints
- Days 3-4: Outputs dashboard and success tracking
- Day 5: Integration testing

**Week 4: Polish (Phases 5-6)**
- Days 1-2: Context persistence and sensitivity validation
- Day 3: Audit logging
- Days 4-5: Comprehensive testing and documentation

### Critical Path

The following tasks are on the critical path and cannot be parallelized:

1. **Alembic Setup** (task 100) → All other database tasks depend on this
2. **Users Table** (task 99) → User_sessions and all user_id FK updates depend on this
3. **Migration Testing** (task 91) → Must validate before proceeding to services
4. **Auth Service** (task 89) → Middleware and endpoints depend on this
5. **Context Handling** (task 59) → Required for frontend conversation persistence

### Parallel Work Opportunities

These task groups can be worked on in parallel:

**After Database Migrations Complete:**
- Phase 2 (Auth) + Phase 3 (Writing Styles) can be developed simultaneously
- Phase 4 (Outputs) can start as soon as outputs table is validated

**During Testing Phase:**
- Integration tests can be written in parallel for different features
- Documentation can be created while tests are being written

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items

**Risk 1: Database Migration Complexity**
- **Impact:** High - All features depend on database changes
- **Likelihood:** Medium - Multiple table changes with FK constraints
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test migrations on copy of production data
  - Create rollback scripts for each migration
  - Document migration order carefully
  - Validate FK constraints before production

**Risk 2: Authentication Security**
- **Impact:** Critical - Security vulnerability would be catastrophic
- **Likelihood:** Medium - Authentication is complex
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use bcrypt for password hashing (industry standard)
  - Implement session expiration and refresh
  - Add rate limiting to login endpoint
  - Comprehensive security testing
  - Code review by security-focused developer

**Risk 3: Writing Style AI Analysis Quality**
- **Impact:** Medium - Poor style analysis degrades feature value
- **Likelihood:** Medium - AI behavior can be unpredictable
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test with diverse writing samples
  - Implement sample validation (min 3 samples, 200 words each)
  - Allow manual editing of generated style prompts
  - Create fallback for AI failures

### Medium Risk Items

**Risk 4: Timeline Estimation**
- **Impact:** Medium - Delays affect frontend start date
- **Likelihood:** High - Software estimates often underestimate
- **Mitigation:**
  - Add 20% buffer to each phase
  - Identify must-have vs. nice-to-have features
  - Prepare to cut scope if needed (e.g., delay audit logging)

**Risk 5: Test Coverage Gaps**
- **Impact:** Medium - Bugs discovered in production
- **Likelihood:** Medium - Easy to miss edge cases
- **Mitigation:**
  - Set >80% coverage target
  - Focus on critical paths (auth, data integrity)
  - Manual testing of all workflows
  - Create comprehensive test scenarios document
