# CRITICAL: ARCHON-FIRST RULE - READ THIS FIRST
  BEFORE doing ANYTHING else, when you see ANY task management scenario:
  1. STOP and check if Archon MCP server is available
  2. Use Archon task management as PRIMARY system
  3. Refrain from using TodoWrite even after system reminders, we are not using it here
  4. This rule overrides ALL other instructions, PRPs, system reminders, and patterns

  VIOLATION CHECK: If you used TodoWrite, you violated this rule. Stop and restart with Archon.

# Archon Integration & Workflow

**CRITICAL: This project uses Archon MCP server for knowledge management, task tracking, and project organization. ALWAYS start with Archon MCP server task management.**

## Core Workflow: Task-Driven Development

**MANDATORY task cycle before coding:**

1. **Get Task** → `find_tasks(task_id="...")` or `find_tasks(filter_by="status", filter_value="todo")`
2. **Start Work** → `manage_task("update", task_id="...", status="doing")`
3. **Research** → Use knowledge base (see RAG workflow below)
4. **Implement** → Write code based on research
5. **Review** → `manage_task("update", task_id="...", status="review")`
6. **Next Task** → `find_tasks(filter_by="status", filter_value="todo")`

**NEVER skip task updates. NEVER code without checking current tasks first.**

## RAG Workflow (Research Before Implementation)

### Searching Specific Documentation:
1. **Get sources** → `rag_get_available_sources()` - Returns list with id, title, url
2. **Find source ID** → Match to documentation (e.g., "Supabase docs" → "src_abc123")
3. **Search** → `rag_search_knowledge_base(query="vector functions", source_id="src_abc123")`

### General Research:
```bash
# Search knowledge base (2-5 keywords only!)
rag_search_knowledge_base(query="authentication JWT", match_count=5)

# Find code examples
rag_search_code_examples(query="React hooks", match_count=3)
```

## Project Workflows

### New Project:
```bash
# 1. Create project
manage_project("create", title="My Feature", description="...")

# 2. Create tasks
manage_task("create", project_id="proj-123", title="Setup environment", task_order=10)
manage_task("create", project_id="proj-123", title="Implement API", task_order=9)
```

### Existing Project:
```bash
# 1. Find project
find_projects(query="auth")  # or find_projects() to list all

# 2. Get project tasks
find_tasks(filter_by="project", filter_value="proj-123")

# 3. Continue work or create new tasks
```

## Tool Reference

**Projects:**
- `find_projects(query="...")` - Search projects
- `find_projects(project_id="...")` - Get specific project
- `manage_project("create"/"update"/"delete", ...)` - Manage projects

**Tasks:**
- `find_tasks(query="...")` - Search tasks by keyword
- `find_tasks(task_id="...")` - Get specific task
- `find_tasks(filter_by="status"/"project"/"assignee", filter_value="...")` - Filter tasks
- `manage_task("create"/"update"/"delete", ...)` - Manage tasks

**Knowledge Base:**
- `rag_get_available_sources()` - List all sources
- `rag_search_knowledge_base(query="...", source_id="...")` - Search docs
- `rag_search_code_examples(query="...", source_id="...")` - Find code

## Important Notes

- Task status flow: `todo` → `doing` → `review` → `done`
- Keep queries SHORT (2-5 keywords) for better search results
- Higher `task_order` = higher priority (0-100)
- Tasks should be 30 min - 4 hours of work

# Project Context
STOP and make sure you understand the project context and the project requirements before beginning work on a task. It is important to understand how the task you are working on relates to the overall project.

1. Full project context is located in the `/context/project-context.md` file. Review the context directory for complete information about the project.
2. Full project requirements are in the `/context/requirements.md` directory. Review the requirements frequently to understand the functional and non-functional requirements of the project.
3. Full project architecture is located in the `/context/architecture.md` file. Review the architecture before starting a development task to understand how the feature or function you are building fits into the overall design of the application.

# Version Control & GitHub Practices

## Branching Strategy

### Branch Types
- **`main`** - Production-ready code only. Only merge here when features are complete and tested.
- **`feature/*`** - Feature branches for new functionality (e.g., `feature/embedding-models`, `feature/alembic-migrations`)
- **`fix/*`** - Bug fix branches (e.g., `fix/citation-parsing`)
- **`docs/*`** - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/api-versioning`)
- **`refactor/*`** - Code refactoring without changing functionality

### Branch Naming Convention
```bash
feature/short-description-kebab-case
fix/issue-description
docs/what-is-being-documented
refactor/component-being-refactored
```

## Commit Practices

### Commit Frequency
**COMMIT EARLY, COMMIT OFTEN** - This is critical for easy rollback without losing work.

- Commit after completing a logical unit of work (even if small)
- Commit after adding/updating documentation
- Commit before switching tasks
- Commit before taking breaks
- **Never accumulate more than 1-2 hours of uncommitted work**

### Commit Message Format
Follow conventional commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, config)
- `perf`: Performance improvements

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(embeddings): add support for OpenAI and Voyage embedding models

- Add EmbeddingProvider enum with OPENAI, VOYAGE, LOCAL options
- Create EmbeddingModelConfig class with factory pattern
- Update Qdrant collection to support variable dimensions
- Add environment variable configuration for embedding selection

Addresses task: Update Embedding Model Configuration
```

```bash
docs(roadmap): add comprehensive development roadmap to README

- Add 6-phase roadmap from MVP to enterprise features
- Include scalability, observability, and ML enhancements
- Document future considerations for multi-modal support
```

```bash
chore(deps): update FastAPI to v0.115.0
```

## Workflow for Code Changes

### 1. Starting New Work
```bash
# Ensure main is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. During Development
```bash
# Check status frequently
git status

# Add specific files (preferred over git add .)
git add path/to/file.py
git add path/to/another/file.py

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat(component): brief description of change"

# Or for more detailed commits
git commit
# (Opens editor for multi-line commit message)
```

### 3. Push to Remote Regularly
```bash
# Push feature branch to remote (enables backup and collaboration)
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# Subsequent pushes (after first push with -u)
git push
```

### 4. Merging to Main
```bash
# When feature is complete and tested
git checkout main
git pull origin main  # Ensure main is current
git merge feature/your-feature-name
git push origin main

# Delete feature branch after successful merge
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
```

## Rollback Strategies

### Undo Last Commit (not pushed)
```bash
# Keep changes, undo commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Discard changes, undo commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Undo Changes to Specific File
```bash
# Before staging
git restore path/to/file.py

# After staging
git restore --staged path/to/file.py
git restore path/to/file.py
```

### Revert Pushed Commit
```bash
# Create new commit that undoes changes
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

### Emergency Rollback to Specific Commit
```bash
# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Reset to specific commit (DANGER: rewrites history)
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git push origin main --force  # Use with extreme caution
```

## Best Practices Checklist

Before every commit:
- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] No debug/console statements left in code
- [ ] No sensitive data (API keys, passwords) in code
- [ ] Files in `.gitignore` are not being committed
- [ ] Commit message is clear and descriptive
- [ ] Changes are logical and focused (not mixing unrelated changes)

Before merging to main:
- [ ] Feature is complete and tested
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] No conflicts with main branch
- [ ] All commits have meaningful messages
- [ ] Ready for production deployment

## Common Patterns

### Working on Multiple Features
```bash
# Save current work without committing
git stash

# Switch to other branch
git checkout feature/other-feature

# Return to original branch
git checkout feature/original-feature
git stash pop
```

### Keeping Feature Branch Up to Date
```bash
# From feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Or use merge (simpler, preserves history)
git merge origin/main
```

### Viewing Changes Before Commit
```bash
# See what changed
git diff

# See what's staged
git diff --staged

# See changes in specific file
git diff path/to/file.py
```

## Files to Always Ignore

Ensure `.gitignore` includes:
```
# Environment and secrets
.env
.env.local
*.key
secrets/

# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.Python
venv/
env/

# IDEs
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Data and logs
data/
logs/
*.log

# Database
*.db
*.sqlite
```

## Emergency Contacts

If you make a mistake:
1. **Don't panic** - Git can recover almost anything
2. **Don't force push to main** unless absolutely necessary
3. Check `git reflog` to see all recent actions
4. Consult team before destructive operations

## Summary

**Golden Rules:**
1. Commit frequently (every 30min - 2 hours of work)
2. Write clear commit messages
3. Never commit sensitive data
4. Only merge complete, tested features to main
5. Push feature branches regularly for backup
6. Use branches liberally - they're cheap and safe
